                left behind are some reasons why older people are rejecting

              A repetitive task can be defined as an action or work performed by
              a person that are repeated many times and is therefore boring.
            </p>

              Automation can help savvy companies grow the bottom line in a
              number of ways. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it's also proven
              essential for keeping businesses on track through supply chain
              disruptions, remote work, and many other challenges.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading"></h2>
            <p>
              Few people enjoy repetitive tasks like data entry or email
              follow-up. Automating those tasks can free up employee's time to
              focus on the kind of innovative, value-added work that can only be
              done by a human, and that many find more satisfying. It's not
              surprising, then, that Zapier found that 90% of surveyed knowledge
              workers agreed that automation has improved people's lives in the
              workplace, or that 65% report that automating manual tasks has
              decreased their stress level.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">
              So, if automation is good, why do some people don't like it?
            </h2>
            <p>
              It seems that the problem lies not in automation itself, but in
              adapting to the new process that was brought by automation. Some
              people hate that they will need to study again a process that is
              working perfectly for them.

              By default, the human nature is to resist new and disruptive
              changes. Technology is used in every facet of everyday life
              because it can provide the speed, connectivity, and efficiency to
              make tasks easier. Nowadays, everyone wants things to be easier and
              faster and for an older adult, it's important not to underestimate
              how technology can help them in their golden years.

              The Bottom Line
            </h2>
            <p>
              These are the main reasons some people struggle with technology. But aside from these significant barriers that they may face, there is another very common one: they often mention the lack of instructions and guidance. The world has evolved, and it is becoming more and more important for them to keep learning.
